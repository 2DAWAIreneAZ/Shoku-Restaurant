					<h2>Kobe Beek Steak</h2>
					<p>
						Our Kobe Beef Steak features certified A5 Wagyu from Hyōgo Prefecture, renowned for its unmatched marbling and melt-in-the-mouth texture. The cut is seared with precise heat control to honor the purity of its intramuscular fat and enhance its natural sweetness. 
						<br><br>
						It is served with seasonal vegetables, Japanese sea salt, and a delicate reduction of aged soy sauce. Every component is crafted to frame the intensity of a product raised under strict standards of tradition and care. A dish that represents the pinnacle of Japanese beef.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="plate">
					<img src="assets/img/fugu.png">
					<h2>Fugu</h2>
					<p>
						Our fugu originates from the coastal waters of Shimonoseki, Japan’s pufferfish capital, and is prepared exclusively by licensed chefs, ensuring absolute precision and safety. It is served in ultra-thin tessa sashimi slices, paired with citrus ponzu, scallion, and momiji oroshi to balance its clean and refined flavor. 
						<br><br>
						The texture is firm yet delicately elastic, allowing its natural purity to shine. It may also be served as nabe, where the broth draws out deeper nuances of the fish. A dish reserved for those who appreciate Japan’s most exquisite and ceremonial traditions.
					</p>

			<div class="creations">
				<div class="plate">
					<img src="assets/img/awabi.png">
					<h2>Awabi steak</h2>
					<p>
						This dish features wild abalone from Hokkaido, one of the most prized varieties for its firm flesh and sweet oceanic flavor. The awabi is gently cooked with Japanese butter, high-quality sake, and aged soy sauce, achieving a tender yet pleasantly resilient texture. 
						<br><br>
						It is served with Japanese spinach, lemon, and a shellfish-based glaze that intensifies its natural aroma. Each piece is carefully cleaned and massaged before cooking, following traditional methods that ensure optimal softness. A celebration of the Japanese sea in its most noble and refined form.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="plate">
					<img src="assets/img/wagyu-sukiyaki.png">
					<h2>Wagyu Sukiyaki</h2>
					<p>
						This sukiyaki is crafted with A5 Wagyu from Kagoshima, celebrated for its balance of tenderness and deep, elegant flavor. The beef is gently simmered in a handcrafted warishita broth made with premium soy sauce, aged mirin, and Japanese brown sugar. 
						<br><br>
						It is accompanied by silky tofu, shiitake mushrooms, negi, hakusai, and shirataki noodles, all of which absorb the sweet-salty essence of the stew. The dish is traditionally finished by dipping each slice of wagyu into a bowl of fresh Japanese egg, creating a smooth and velvety texture. A classic elevated to its most luxurious expression.

					<p>
						At Shoku, excellence begins long before ingredients reach the kitchen. Every element we use is the result of a meticulous search for the purest origin, the most dedicated producer, and the most respectful tradition. We believe quality is not a final attribute but a journey: it is born from the land, shaped by the climate, nurtured by expert hands, and brought to the table guided by those who honor nature.
					</p>
					<p>
						We select our ingredients based on three unwavering principles: purity, traceability, and mastery at the source. Every product must tell a story and preserve the soul of its place of origin. We do not seek abundance; we seek rarity. We do not pursue superficial luxury; we pursue deep authenticity.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<img src="assets/img/wagyu-procedence.png">

				<div class="procedence">
					<p>
						Our wagyu comes exclusively from certified producers in Hyōgo, Mie, and Kagoshima, regions where cattle raising is treated as an ancestral art. Each cow grows in a serene, stress-free environment, fed with selected grains and spring water.
					</p>
					<p>
						Its perfect marbling—an emblem of harmony between fat and muscle—is the result of decades of careful breeding and dedicated care. Every A5 cut that enters our kitchen is accompanied by its official certificate of origin, ensuring full traceability and impeccable quality standards.
					</p>
				</div>

				<img src="assets/img/shellfish-procedence.png">

				<div class="procedence">
					<p>
						For our sushi and sashimi we source fish directly from the Toyosu Market in Tokyo, home to the most rigorous auction system in the world.
						<br><br>
						Our suppliers participate in the “quality rods” inspections, where experts evaluate color, fat content, firmness, freshness, and texture before purchase. 
						<br><br>
						Bluefin tuna, hamachi, tai, and other premium fish arrive in our kitchen within 48 hours of auction, preserving their purity and natural character.
					</p>
					<p>
						At Shoku, quality is never negotiated—it is honored. Every ingredient is chosen for its origin, its story, and the expert hands that cultivate or harvest it.
						<br><br>
						We work only with suppliers who share our philosophy: respect for nature, traditional techniques, and perfection without shortcuts.
						<br><br>
						Because we believe that every dish must be an authentic encounter with Japan, and that encounter begins in the earth, the sea, and the hands that treat each ingredient with devotion.

						<h2>Koshu Kiiroka</h2>
						<p>
							An exquisitely refined Japanese white wine made from the ancient Koshu grape, a varietal with over 1,000 years of history. It offers delicate aromas of yuzu, plum blossom, and white peach, with soft acidity and a crystalline texture. Production is extremely limited, making it a rare gem even within Japan. Elegant, minimalistic, and almost ethereal in its purity.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="wine-content">
						<h2>Nana-Tsu-Mori Pinot Noir</h2>
						<p>
							This micro-produced Pinot Noir is a highly sought-after rarity. Grown in the cool climate of Hokkaido, it shows an elegant aromatic profile with wild raspberry, rose petals, black tea, and alpine herbs. It recalls a fine Burgundy while preserving the vibrant character of the Japanese terroir. Annual production is tiny, and bottles vanish instantly in auctions.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="wine-content">
						<h2>Noëlla</h2>
						<p>
							A cult Japanese natural wine produced by the historic Château Soga. Made from Pinot Noir and local varietals, it presents earthy, fruity, and floral nuances in perfect harmony. Its silky texture and aromatic depth give it an expressive and emotional character. Due to its microscopic production, it is nearly impossible to find outside Japan.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="wine-content">
						<h2>Koshu Aged in Barrique</h2>
						<p>
							An exquisitely refined Japanese white wine made from the ancient Koshu grape, a varietal with over 1,000 years of history. It offers delicate aromas of yuzu, plum blossom, and white peach, with soft acidity and a crystalline texture. Production is extremely limited, making it a rare gem even within Japan. Elegant, minimalistic, and almost ethereal in its purity.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="wine-content">
						<h2>Kerner Special Cuvée</h2>
						<p>
							A sophisticated and aromatic white wine made from the Kerner grape in one of Japan’s coldest wine regions. It offers notes of pear, green apple, and white flowers, with vibrant freshness and marked minerality. Its elegance and extremely limited production make it suitable only for exceptional occasions.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="wine-content">
						<h2>Kikyogahara Merlot</h2>
						<p>
							One of Japan’s most prestigious and expensive red wines. It comes from the high-altitude Kikyogahara vineyard in Nagano, an area known for its purity of climate and exceptional growing conditions. Produced with a Bordeaux-inspired winemaking approach and released in extremely limited quantities, it has become a cult wine within Japan and a highly sought-after bottle among collectors.
